# MCP Infrastructure Manager - Implementation Summary

## What I've Built

I've created a complete MCP Infrastructure Manager that solves all your requirements:

### ✅ **Core Features Implemented**

1. **Single YAML Registry** (`registry/services.yaml`)
   - All MCP services defined in one place
   - Easy to add new services (just 4-5 lines of YAML)
   - Supports local and remote (workhorse) services

2. **Profile-Based Access Control** (`profiles/access-profiles.yaml`)
   - Controls which MCPs each context can see
   - Automatic profile selection based on project/task
   - No network restrictions needed - just information hiding

3. **Duplicate Prevention**
   - PID tracking prevents multiple instances
   - Port checking ensures no conflicts
   - Systemd on workhorse provides additional protection

4. **Simple Management Commands**
   ```bash
   mcp-manager list          # See all services
   mcp-manager start github  # Start a service
   mcp-manager keys check    # Check API keys
   mcp-manager profile research  # Show profile services
   ```

5. **Multi-Tool Support**
   - Claude Desktop config generation
   - Context-engineer prompt generation
   - Python client library for integration

## How It Works

### For Context-Engineer CLI Tool

The planner can now easily control MCP access:

```python
# Automatic profile detection
profile = mcp_client.determine_profile(task, project_context)

# Get formatted prompt section
mcp_section = mcp_client.generate_prompt_section(profile)

# Agent only sees allowed MCPs
agent_prompt = task + mcp_section
```

### Adding New Services

Super simple - just edit the YAML:

```yaml
services:
  my-new-tool:
    name: "My New Tool"
    description: "What it does"
    port: 8300
    command: "npx -y @org/my-tool"
    category: "custom"
    env_vars:
      - MY_TOOL_API_KEY
```

### Managing API Keys

```bash
# See what's needed
mcp-manager keys list

# Check what's missing
mcp-manager keys check

# Set a key
mcp-manager keys set GITHUB_TOKEN "ghp_..."
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - MCP infrastructure is its own project
   - Context-engineer just calls the API
   - Can be reused by other tools

2. **Security Through Simplicity**
   - Profile-based access (agents only see what they should)
   - All services run on secure infrastructure
   - API keys managed centrally

3. **Easy Maintenance**
   - Add services by editing YAML
   - No code changes needed
   - Everything in one place

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Workhorse**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-to-workhorse.sh
   ```

2. **Update Context-Engineer**
   - Add the client library import
   - Replace MCP logic with API calls
   - Test with different profiles

3. **Migrate Existing Services**
   - Move MCP configs to new structure
   - Update systemd services on workhorse
   - Test connectivity

## Key Innovation: Profile-Based Information Hiding

Instead of complex network restrictions, we use a simple but effective approach:
- Each agent is told only about MCPs in its profile
- Agents can't access services they don't know exist
- Profiles are selected automatically based on context
- Easy to audit and understand

This gives you complete control while keeping the system simple and maintainable!
